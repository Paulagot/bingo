# Starting the Bingo Application

## Quick Start (Recommended)

Double-click **`start-quick.bat`** to:
- Start the development server
- Open your browser automatically to http://localhost:5173
- Keep the server running in a separate window

## Full Start (With Checks)

Double-click **`start.bat`** to:
- Check if Node.js and npm are installed
- Install dependencies if needed
- Verify servers are ready before opening browser
- Start the development server
- Open your browser automatically

## Manual Start

If you prefer to start manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
```

## URLs

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001

## Stopping the Server

- Close the server window (the one showing npm logs)
- Or press `Ctrl+C` in that window

## Notes

- The server window will show logs from both frontend (Vite) and backend (Express)
- The browser will open automatically after servers start
- Servers run in a separate window so you can see the logs
