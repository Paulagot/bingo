//! # Event Definitions
//!
//! Events emitted by the Fundraisely program for off-chain indexing and real-time UI updates.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! Events enable:
//! - **Frontend Real-time Updates**: WebSocket listeners can update UI instantly when events fire
//! - **Historical Data**: Indexers can build complete transaction history
//! - **Analytics**: Track platform metrics (total raised, active rooms, player participation)
//! - **Audit Trail**: Immutable record of all platform activity
//!
//! ## Frontend Integration Example
//!
//! ```typescript
//! const listenerId = program.addEventListener("RoomCreated", (event, slot) => {
//!   console.log(`New room: ${event.roomId} by ${event.host}`);
//!   refreshRoomList();
//! });
//! ```
