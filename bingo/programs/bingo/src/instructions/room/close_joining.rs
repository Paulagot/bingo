//! # Close Joining Instruction
//!
//! Allows host to close a room to new players before reaching max capacity.
//! Useful when host wants to start the game early or lock the player list.
//!
//! ## Security
//! - Only the room host can call this
//! - Can only be called before room has ended
//! - Cannot be reversed (one-way operation)
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```typescript
//! await program.methods
//!   .closeJoining(roomId)
//!   .accounts({ room, host })
//!   .rpc();
//! ```

use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use crate::{Room, RoomStatus, BingoError, JoiningClosed as JoiningClosedEvent, CloseJoining};
